# Everything starts here

Today will officially be my first day on my journey into becoming a full time smart contract auditor.

It is not my actual first day, maybe the 5th or 6th, but this first days served for a couple of things.

## Trainning my algortihm

The other day I saw the importance of sinknig yourself into the topic you are trying to learn. In this case, Twitter is the way I started to embed myself into the world of smart contract auditing, following a bunch of well-known auditors and people in the space.

This was the first step into the rabbit hole, but I needed to do more. I needed to start reading the articles and papers that these people were sharing, and that's where the twitter algorithm comes in.

I don't need to search much to discover new cool blogs or useful websites, the algorithm does it for me. I just need to keep reading and liking the content I find interesting.

## Getting my tools ready

In this first five or so days, I was ablt to quickly create what I think are two useful tools, not only for me, but also for the community.

### Useful websites

- [sec-eth.xyz](https://sec-eth.xyz): A websites that compiles all the security related resources I have found so far. It is a work in progress, but I think it is already useful.

- [filter4rena](filter4rena.vercel.app): This is quite a useful tool for someone starting out auditing [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/). It is a simple filter that allows you to filter vulnerabilities by severity or fuzzy search for a specific vulnerability.

### Dev stuff

In terms of my dev environment, I have been using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) extension. I'm a [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) enjoyer so that's my testing framework of choice. Also a bunch of extensions to make my life easier, like the **solidity visual developer** one from [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/) and a couple more.

## Engage

Another crucial part of this journey is to engage with the community. Talk to people on Twitter, join the discord channels, and participate in the conversations, you will not only learn a shit ton of new things but also make cool connections.

## Wrapping up

This post was kinda lenghty, next ones won't be like this. I will try to make this posts as useful as possible for a newcomer, therefore, they will include new learnings and technical stuff I find cool to share.

I have some experience coding, but I'm a consider myself quite a junior in Solidity, so if you are in the same situation, welcome and have reading learning with me.
