Today I managed to finish the first challenge of [EVM Through CTFs](https://www.evmthroughctfs.com/) completely, I'm now going through a pretty tough one that seems like it is going to be quite a good learning moment, so be sure I'll be posting about it.

Then I met a friend and we kept chatting until 21:30, I'm pretty tired now but I'll try to get some sleep and then get back to work tomorrow.

Also met some people in discord and we are seeing if we can collaborate on some audits together, I'm pretty excited about that.

## One last thing

As you can see, I already had 2 days which have not been really that productive and even though I would've like to have done some more stuff related to auting, I think it's better to take a break and get some rest, meet your friends and family and I'm sure you'll get back to work with more energy and motivation.
