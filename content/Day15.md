Damn... Today found out about [@IAm0x52](https://twitter.com/IAm0x52) and this tweet he published a few days ago [tweet](https://twitter.com/IAm0x52/status/1649414333590274050?s=20)

Went on and read some of his reports using [solodit](https://solodit.xyz/) by filtering the *finder* field writing *0x52* and I was really impressed by the amount of bugs he found.

I wonder if I will be able to take private audits in a year, that'd be a dream come true to be honest, really looking forward to be auditing as my day job.

Speaking about jobs, why the fuck do companies have open position pages on their website, if when you apply then they take like 2 weeks to asnwer...

I need a job, so I started searching for some entry level solidity developer roles (I've only been deving in solidity seriously for the past year) in the [web3jobs](https://web3.career/) website, but as I said, already 2 weeks passed and didn't get any answer from neither, so yeah... will keep applying.

## Wrapping up

No techy stuff today, even though I kept playing with some huff, nothing worth sharing, chill day today.
