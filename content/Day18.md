# Keep the job hunt going

Hi everyone, got some semi-good news, let me break them down.

I'm currently applying for a job, this was my idea at the start of this blog project, I want this blog to be the most valuable resource in terms of veracity and an actual day to day journey of a guy with experience in programming and web3 but a total noob in the security space, and how he managed to get a job in the security space.

Currently I'm tracking the companies I've applied in a Notion database with some basic data to keep tack of the process.

# Why semi-good news?

Well, if you are a daily reader, there might be some days that I might not post anything, or catch up at a later date and post somthing with the corresponding missed date (hope I explained myself XD).

# The next challenge

The next challenge is not about the evm nor about huff, I will try to start bringing good and valuable POCs for vulnerabilities I find during my study period of past reports and writeups with my newly met people in the [opensense](https://twitter.com/opensensepw) community, that's why posts might take longer to be published.

## Wrapping up

So from now on, more POCs and also updates on how the job hunt is going.

I have no idea how many people are reading this daily or if anyone is reading this at all, but if you are, it'd be super awesome if you could just send a DM hehe, it would motivate me to keep going.
