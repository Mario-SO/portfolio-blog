title: "Day21...26 - Finished EigenLayer audit"
---

Wow, what a week, I've been working on the EigenLayer audit with my team for the last 5 days, and I'm super happy with the results, I've learned a lot.

# The auditing process

It was all coordinated via discord and we had some voice chat meetings to discuss current findings and how to further proceed, plus we used channels like `#eigenlayer-resources`, `#eigenlayer-leads`, `#eigenlayer-confirm`. `#eigenlayer-findings` to post our findings and discuss them.

- **#eigenlayer-resources**: Where we posted all the resources we used to audit the project, like the contracts, the docs, the code, etc.

- **#eigenlayer-leads**: Where we posted the potential findings we had, this also served as a discussion channel sometimes.

- **#eigenlayer-confirm**: This was also a channel for potential vulns but when the person who found it wasnt so it needed further confirmation.

- **#eigenlayer-findings**: Where we posted the confirmed findings, this was the channel we used to post the findings that we were sure were bugs or vulnerabilities and had a POC to prove it.

Now that I see it, we could have used a better naming convention for the channels, but it worked out fine, *confirm* and *leads* ended up serving a similar purpose.

We also had a `main` channel where we talked about anything, also to plan out meetings and stuff.

# More comming soon...
