As terrible as a day could get. I was rejected for an internship at Nethermind, and it was the simplest interview imaginable – just a casual technical chat where I was asked about various technical topics.

I was extremely nervous at the beginning and messed up simple questions like "How does a reentrancy attack work?" and even "Explain how a binary search works." When I was asked about the differences between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, I did well. I also fared well when asked about what makes Rust special compared to other languages, about price oracle manipulation, why Solidity is semi-Turing complete, and a couple more questions that I can’t remember.

I genuinely thought the interviewer would see that I was extremely nervous at the start and wouldn't weigh those questions heavily, but it seems they were the most important ones. I must admit they were very basic questions, but still.

I really want to believe that I am a valuable asset to any company. I've learned everything by myself while earning a university degree. I’m a good listener, a passionate learner, and am always tinkering with new tech stuff. But it seems that unless you prove that you are an expert in whatever you do, you won’t get the job.

I just wanted to write this quick post to vent this feeling of being utterly useless that I have right now. I’m extremely sad at the moment and don’t want to do anything. Any little confidence I had in myself has completely vanished. Maybe I’m being too pessimistic, I don’t know, whatever. Hopefully, this isn’t the last post I make.

I know I have two previous posts that I haven’t finished about team audits. I’m not sure if I’ll even complete those. How can I pretend to teach anyone when I can’t even secure a simple internship?

See you.
