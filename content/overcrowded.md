title: "The Overcrowded Landscape of JavaScript Frameworks"
---

JavaScript has come a long way since its inception as a simple scripting language for the web. Today, it is used for a wide range of purposes, from front-end web development to building mobile apps and even desktop applications.

One area where JavaScript has seen particularly rapid growth is in the realm of frameworks. A JavaScript framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for building web applications, making it easier and faster to develop complex applications.

## The Proliferation of JavaScript Frameworks

In recent years, the number of JavaScript frameworks has exploded. There are now dozens of popular frameworks to choose from, each with its own unique set of features and benefits.

This proliferation of frameworks has both pros and cons. On the one hand, it means that developers have a wide range of options to choose from, and can select the framework that best fits their needs. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming to try to keep track of all the different frameworks and their varying features and capabilities.

## The Overcrowded Landscape

With so many frameworks to choose from, it can be difficult for developers to know which one is the best fit for their project. This can lead to a situation where developers are constantly trying out new frameworks, only to eventually move on to the next one.

This constant churn can be frustrating and time-consuming for developers, and it can also make it difficult for companies to make long-term decisions about which frameworks to use and invest in.

Still, there seems to be a big consensus on using the 2 biggest ones (React & Angular) at least for big companies and bigger side projects that devs may want to create.

## The Future of JavaScript Frameworks

It is difficult to predict exactly where the landscape of JavaScript frameworks is headed. It is possible that some of the current frameworks will continue to dominate, while others may fall by the wayside. It is also possible that new frameworks will emerge, further adding to the already overcrowded landscape.

One thing is certain: JavaScript frameworks are here to stay, and they will continue to be a crucial part of the web development landscape. It will be up to individual developers and companies to decide which frameworks are the best fit for their needs, and to navigate the constantly shifting landscape of options.
