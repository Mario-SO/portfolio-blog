title: "Differences Between ERC721 and ERC1155 Token Standards"
---

The Ethereum network is home to a variety of different token standards, each with its own unique features and capabilities. Two of the most well-known token standards are ERC721 and ERC1155.

While both standards are used to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum network, they have some key differences that are important to understand.

## ERC721

ERC721 is a token standard that defines a set of rules for creating and managing non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network. Non-fungible tokens are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged for other tokens or assets on a one-to-one basis.

One of the key features of ERC721 tokens is that they are individually distinct and cannot be replicated. This makes them ideal for representing unique digital assets such as artwork, collectibles, and even virtual real estate.

## ERC1155

ERC1155 is another token standard for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network. However, unlike ERC721 tokens, ERC1155 tokens can contain multiple types of assets within a single contract.

This makes ERC1155 particularly useful for creating complex digital assets that contain multiple components or elements. For example, an ERC1155 token could represent a digital game character that has multiple attributes such as weapons, armor, and other equipment.

## Key Differences

There are several key differences between ERC721 and ERC1155 token standards:

- ERC721 tokens represent individual, unique assets, while ERC1155 tokens can contain multiple types of assets within a single contract.
- ERC721 tokens have a fixed supply, while the supply of ERC1155 tokens can be adjusted.
- ERC721 tokens are typically used to represent individual assets such as artwork or collectibles, while ERC1155 tokens are more often used for complex digital assets that contain multiple components or elements.

## Conclusion

Both ERC721 and ERC1155 are useful token standards for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network. ERC721 is well-suited for representing individual, unique assets, while ERC1155 is better for complex digital assets that contain multiple components or elements.

Ultimately, the choice between ERC721 and ERC1155 will depend on the specific needs and requirements of your project. Both standards have their own unique features and capabilities, and understanding the differences between them can help you make an informed decision about which one is the best fit for your needs.
