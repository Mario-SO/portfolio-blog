title: "Differences Between ERC721 and ERC1155 Token Standards"
---

The Ethereum network is a fascinating ecosystem of smart contracts and decentralized applications. One of the most exciting features of Ethereum is the ability to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using different token standards such as ERC721 and ERC1155.

## ERC721: Uniquely Distinct
ERC721 tokens are the original NFTs on the Ethereum network, and they represent individual, unique assets that cannot be replicated or exchanged for other tokens on a one-to-one basis. They are ideal for creating digital assets that require proof of ownership or authenticity, such as artwork or collectibles.

The ERC721 token standard defines a set of rules for creating and managing NFTs on the Ethereum network. Developers can use this standard to create contracts that issue ERC721 tokens, which can be bought, sold, and traded on various marketplaces.

```solidity
contract ERC721Token {
  // Define variables and mappings here

  // Function to create a new ERC721 token
  function mint(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public {
    // Mint new token and assign ownership to _to
  }

  // Other functions for transferring and managing tokens
}
```

## ERC1155: Complex Assets
ERC1155 tokens are a newer token standard on the Ethereum network that allows for the creation of more complex digital assets. Unlike ERC721 tokens, ERC1155 tokens can contain multiple types of assets within a single contract, making them ideal for creating digital assets with multiple components or elements.

For example, a game developer could create an ERC1155 token that represents a game character with multiple attributes, such as weapons, armor, and other equipment. This allows for more flexible and dynamic gameplay experiences, as players can customize their characters with different items.

```solidity
contract ERC1155Token {
  // Define variables and mappings here

  // Function to create a new ERC1155 token with multiple assets
  function mint(address _to, uint256[] memory _tokenIds, uint256[] memory _amounts, bytes memory _data) public {
    // Mint new token and assign ownership to _to
  }

  // Other functions for transferring and managing tokens
}
```
### Key Differences
There are several key differences between ERC721 and ERC1155 token standards:

ERC721 tokens represent individual, unique assets, while ERC1155 tokens can contain multiple types of assets within a single contract.
ERC721 tokens have a fixed supply, while the supply of ERC1155 tokens can be adjusted.
ERC721 tokens are typically used to represent individual assets such as artwork or collectibles, while ERC1155 tokens are more often used for complex digital assets that contain multiple components or elements.


## Conclusion
Both ERC721 and ERC1155 are powerful token standards for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum network. ERC721 tokens are well-suited for representing individual, unique assets, while ERC1155 tokens are better for complex digital assets that contain multiple components or elements.

By understanding the differences between ERC721 and ERC1155, developers can make an informed decision about which token standard is the best fit for their specific project requirements. Whether you're creating digital art, virtual real estate, or a complex gaming experience, Ethereum's NFT ecosystem has a token standard that can meet your needs.
