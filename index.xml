Signature Malleability This is quite a math heavy thing when you start looking into how it actually works and why, but for the context of an auditor it is enough to know a couple of things.
In Ethereum, the ecrecover function is used to verify signatures.</description></item><item><title>Day04 - Calldata &amp; Foundry</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 10:53:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day04/</guid><description>The other day, I stumbled upon a tweet from @DeGatchi promoting his latest blog post about Reversing the EVM: Raw Calldata and I thought it was so helpful that I decided to write a post about it, not only to share it with you (rando reading this) but also to have a reference for myself.
It includes a foundry CLI mini-masterclass (if that&amp;rsquo;s a thing).
Calldata 101 Super brief ELI5 explanation of calldata:</description></item><item><title>Day03 - Smart Contract Auditing Heuristics</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 04:55:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day03/</guid><description>I found this cool repo on Github that has a list of heuristics for auditing smart contracts. I thought it would be a good idea to go through the ones I found interesting.
Code asymmetries In many projects, there should be some symmetries for different functions.
For instance, a withdraw function should (usually) undo all the state changes of a deposit function and a delete function should undo all the state changes of the corresponding add function.</description></item><item><title>Day02 - People don't read standards</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 05:49:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day02/</guid><description>Today I went on and after doing some Ethernaut challenges, I decided to try and go through open challenges on Code4rena.
Prepared my environment, opened filter4rena, and started looking for some vulns.
First finding When starting to look at the contracts I quickly found this line of code that caught my attention:
ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount); Even though this was my first ever real audit, I have been reading a lot of blog posts and common vulnerabilities, so I knew that this line of code was considered a vulnerability because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t check the return value of the transfer function, and some tokens do not revert when the transfer fails but instead return false.</description></item><item><title>Day01 - The Journey Begins</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 04:10:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day01/</guid><description>Everything starts here Today will officially be my first day on my journey into becoming a full time smart contract auditor.
It is not my actual first day, maybe the 5th or 6th, but this first days served for a couple of things.
Trainning my algortihm The other day I saw the importance of sinknig yourself into the topic you are trying to learn. In this case, Twitter is the way I started to embed myself into the world of smart contract auditing, following a bunch of well-known auditors and people in the space.</description></item></channel></rss>
