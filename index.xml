The team is key I&amp;rsquo;m super grateful for the opportunity to be part of this team, I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot from them, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I will learn a lot more in the future, they are really welcoming for newcomers like me, and don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to answer any question I might have and share their knowledge with me.</description></item><item><title>Day19 - 1 wei attack</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day19/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 13:35:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day19/</guid><description>The learning is starting to flourish XD. As I told you in a previous post, I joined a team of people for auditing and I&amp;rsquo;m learning a shit ton of stuff, which of course, will also share with everyone reading this posts of mine hehe.
ELI5 1 wei attack First of all this is also known as inflation attack on EIP-4626.
In simple terms, the inflation attack on EIP-4626 is an exploit where an attacker manipulates the exchange rate between a vault&amp;rsquo;s shares and its underlying assets, causing a victim to lose their deposited assets.</description></item><item><title>Day18 - Preparing for the next challenge</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day18/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 12:52:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day18/</guid><description>Keep the job hunt going Hi everyone, got some semi-good news, let me break them down.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently applying for a job, this was my idea at the start of this blog project, I want this blog to be the most valuable resource in terms of veracity and an actual day to day journey of a guy with experience in programming and web3 but a total noob in the security space, and how he managed to get a job in the security space.</description></item><item><title>Day17 - Huff magic continues</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day17/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 15:09:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day17/</guid><description>Hey there, huff enthusiasts! I&amp;rsquo;m back with more huff adventures and some insights into storage in Ethereum smart contracts. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to share them with you! I&amp;rsquo;m still on cloud nine from my recent progress in understanding huff and the EVM. So, today, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into storage and how it works in Ethereum smart contracts.
Ethereum Smart Contract Storage In Ethereum, smart contract storage is a key-value store that allows you to store and access data persistently.</description></item><item><title>Day16 - They see me huffing, they hatin'</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 12:00:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day16/</guid><description>Hehe sorry, but I can&amp;rsquo;t stop playing with huff, It is cool when you start to be able to fix your own mistakes, I think that&amp;rsquo;s a point in which you are starting to understand new stuff.
So today I bring two more challenges from the repo I shared in a previous post.
Non-Payable The task is to write within the MAIN macro, huff code that reverts if ether is sent with the transaction.</description></item><item><title>Day15 - Impressive guy &amp; Job hunting</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day15/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 12:33:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day15/</guid><description>Damn&amp;hellip; Today found out about @IAm0x52 and this tweet he published a few days ago tweet
Went on and read some of his reports using solodit by filtering the finder field writing 0x52 and I was really impressed by the amount of bugs he found.
I wonder if I will be able to take private audits in a year, that&amp;rsquo;d be a dream come true to be honest, really looking forward to be auditing as my day job.</description></item><item><title>Day14 - Moar huffing</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day14/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 17:23:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day14/</guid><description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get too much done today, made a very hard and sad decision and&amp;hellip; well, I needed to rest and take some time for myself.
So I can only show what I did today, which is not much, and actually has been between today and yesterday.
More huff challenges I was only able to finish the Multiply challenge from the repo I shared in the previous post.
he task is to write within the MAIN macro below, a function named multiply that takes in 2 uint256s, and returns their product.</description></item><item><title>Day13 - Huff, learning &amp; bonuses</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day13/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 08:51:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day13/</guid><description>Yooooo, first of all I want to thank anyone reading this, it keeps me motivated knowing that there is someone out there reading my posts so, thank you!
Shoutout to @0xMackenzieM who talked to me via DM giving me some feedback on my approach with this blog. If I ever get nearly half on the knowledge he has, don&amp;rsquo;t doubt a single second that I will pay it forward.
Now to the huff stuff.</description></item><item><title>Day12 - Weponizing Gas</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day12/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 12:06:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day12/</guid><description>Today, reading through some past reports on Solodit I found out about this interesting exploit that is known under the name of 1/64 rule.
The EVM limits the total gas forwarded on to 63/64ths of the total gasleft() (and silently reduces it to this value if we try to send more)
Example This is the report from Sherlock that I was reading.
I still don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand how this works though, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain it as best as I can.</description></item><item><title>Day11 - Code is not law</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:05:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day11/</guid><description>Going back again with yet another challenge from EVM Through CTFs, but this time, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a solution yet, I&amp;rsquo;m still working on it.
Still, will share the point at which I&amp;rsquo;m at right now so in the future I can look back and see how stupid I was hehe.
The challenge Today&amp;rsquo;s challenge consists on getting CodeIsNotLaw tokens from a minter contract, but it is not as straight forward as calling the mint function.</description></item><item><title>Day10 - Same bytecode, different code</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 11:13:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day10/</guid><description>Continuing with the EVM Through CTFs challenges, today I was able to solve a pretty interesting challenge.
The challenge In this case the challenge consisted on winning a game agains a bot smart contract (khabib) at the game 0xships.
The thing is that the bot khabib is quite a good player and his code is pretty complex, so trying to build your own bot was completely out of the equation.</description></item><item><title>Day09 - Busy af...</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day09/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 15:44:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day09/</guid><description>Today I managed to finish the first challenge of EVM Through CTFs completely, I&amp;rsquo;m now going through a pretty tough one that seems like it is going to be quite a good learning moment, so be sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting about it.
Then I met a friend and we kept chatting until 21:30, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired now but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to get some sleep and then get back to work tomorrow.</description></item><item><title>Day08 - Going deeper into the EVM</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day08/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2023 14:11:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day08/</guid><description>As we were saying&amp;hellip; Today I went on and tried the EVM Through CTFs challenges and, oh god are they good.
Even though the first challenge is a bit of a warmup (especially if you read my previous post Day04 - Calldata &amp;amp; Foundry) it rapidly gets harder and harder, I&amp;rsquo;m actually stuck in the last part of challenge one, but I&amp;rsquo;ll get there.
Opcodes &amp;amp; Stack resources The first thing I did was to look at the EVM Opcodes and evm.</description></item><item><title>Day07 - One of those days</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day07/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 09:17:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day07/</guid><description>Can&amp;rsquo;t share much today, I had such a busy day today that I could only dedicate 1 hour to my learning journey.
Still, managed to discover a new site that perfectly fits my needs for now: EVM Through CTFs
I will go through the first challenge tomorrow and hopefully finish it by the end of the day so I can write about it in the next post.</description></item><item><title>Day06 - VIP_Bank</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 12:09:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day06/</guid><description>Recently I discovered on Twitter this challenges page from Quill Audits, and I decided to give it a try.
I started with the VIPBank challenge, which is a smart contract that allows you to deposit and withdraw funds from it. The challenge consists on locking the contract, aka DoS attack.
The contract pragma solidity 0.8.7; contract VIP_Bank{ address public manager; mapping(address =&amp;gt; uint) public balances; mapping(address =&amp;gt; bool) public VIP; uint public maxETH = 0.</description></item><item><title>Day05 - 3 attack vectors</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day05/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 09:57:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day05/</guid><description>Today I was lucky to get in time to an @opensensepw discord study session where @mis4nthr0pic was going through a couple of attack vectors in the Solidity-Security-Compendium
Signature Malleability This is quite a math heavy thing when you start looking into how it actually works and why, but for the context of an auditor it is enough to know a couple of things.
In Ethereum, the ecrecover function is used to verify signatures.</description></item><item><title>Day04 - Calldata &amp; Foundry</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 10:53:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day04/</guid><description>The other day, I stumbled upon a tweet from @DeGatchi promoting his latest blog post about Reversing the EVM: Raw Calldata and I thought it was so helpful that I decided to write a post about it, not only to share it with you (rando reading this) but also to have a reference for myself.
It includes a foundry CLI mini-masterclass (if that&amp;rsquo;s a thing).
Calldata 101 Super brief ELI5 explanation of calldata:</description></item><item><title>Day03 - Smart Contract Auditing Heuristics</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 04:55:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day03/</guid><description>I found this cool repo on Github that has a list of heuristics for auditing smart contracts. I thought it would be a good idea to go through the ones I found interesting.
Code asymmetries In many projects, there should be some symmetries for different functions.
For instance, a withdraw function should (usually) undo all the state changes of a deposit function and a delete function should undo all the state changes of the corresponding add function.</description></item><item><title>Day02 - People don't read standards</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 05:49:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day02/</guid><description>Today I went on and after doing some Ethernaut challenges, I decided to try and go through open challenges on Code4rena.
Prepared my environment, opened filter4rena, and started looking for some vulns.
First finding When starting to look at the contracts I quickly found this line of code that caught my attention:
ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount); Even though this was my first ever real audit, I have been reading a lot of blog posts and common vulnerabilities, so I knew that this line of code was considered a vulnerability because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t check the return value of the transfer function, and some tokens do not revert when the transfer fails but instead return false.</description></item><item><title>Day01 - The Journey Begins</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 04:10:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day01/</guid><description>Everything starts here Today will officially be my first day on my journey into becoming a full time smart contract auditor.
It is not my actual first day, maybe the 5th or 6th, but this first days served for a couple of things.
Trainning my algortihm The other day I saw the importance of sinknig yourself into the topic you are trying to learn. In this case, Twitter is the way I started to embed myself into the world of smart contract auditing, following a bunch of well-known auditors and people in the space.</description></item></channel></rss>
