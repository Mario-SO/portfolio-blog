Still, will share the point at which I&amp;rsquo;m at right now so in the future I can look back and see how stupid I was hehe.
The challenge Today&amp;rsquo;s challenge consists on getting CodeIsNotLaw tokens from a minter contract, but it is not as straight forward as calling the mint function.</description></item><item><title>Day10 - Same bytecode, different code</title><link>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 11:13:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://blog.mariodev.xyz/day10/</guid><description>Continuing with the EVM Through CTFs challenges, today I was able to solve a pretty interesting challenge.

It includes a foundry CLI mini-masterclass (if that&amp;rsquo;s a thing).
